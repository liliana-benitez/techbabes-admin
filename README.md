# Tech Babes Admin

This is an internal dashboard I built for [Tech Babes](https://techbabes.dev/), my e-commerce brand for women in tech.
Right now, it helps me view and manage inventory in one place without relying solely on Etsy or Printful dashboards, since I am also creating my own shop frontend.

The long-term goal is for this to become a central control panel for the business, with insights and stats coming next.

## What It Does (So Far)

- View current inventory
- Update inventory easily
- Simple UI
- Built as a private/internal tool

## Planned Features

- Sales and inventory stats
- Basic analytics (what’s selling, what’s not)
- Trends over time
- Possibly other internal admin tools as the shop grows

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Prisma
- Supabase(SQL)
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn
- Framer Motion

## Why I Built This

I wanted a lightweight, custom dashboard tailored exactly to my needs. Something simple, fast, and pleasant to use. It’s also a way for me to practice building real internal tools that connect frontend, backend, and database logic in a clean way.

## 🚧 Status

This project is actively evolving. Inventory management is live, and stats/analytics are planned next.
